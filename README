Windows Build of OpenVDB 
by lithozine (April 22, 2015)
================================================================================

The repository forks named win_openexr and win_openvdb, contain updated
CMakefiles and bug fixes to allow for building of OpenVDB on Windows.
The following instructions show how to easily build on Windows 7 64-bit, 
with Visual Studio 2010, in debug and release modes.

Please post questions/comments to:
  www.openvdb.org/forum, on the thread "[Solution] OpenVDB 3.0 for Win 7 64-bit / VS2010"

The main idea behind this build is to keep a clear separation between 
the source code and the final build outputs and projects. 

Instructons follow:

1) Create the following folder structure 

\code	
  \build
    \boost_1_57_0	Install from boost_1_57_0-msvc-10.0-64.exe at
                             http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.57.0/
    \glew-1.11.0	Install from http://sourceforge.net/projects/glew/files/glew/1.11.0/
    \glfw	Install from http://www.glfw.org/	
    \tbb43	Install from https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/
  \source
    \zlib	Git Clone from https://github.com/rchoetzlein/zlib.git
    \win_openvdb	Git Clone from https://github.com/rchoetzlein/win_openvdb.git
    \win_openexr	Git Clone from https://github.com/rchoetzlein/win_openexr.git

Notice that the git clone source repositories are kept separate from the build pre-requisites.
At this point, the \build folder should contain unpacked installations of the existing libraries shown above.
The \source folder should contain a git clone of these forked repositories.

                          OpenVDB Development Repository
================================================================================

This GitHub repository hosts the trunk of the OpenVDB development. This implies
that it is the newest public version with the latest features and bug fixes.
However, it also means that it has not undergone a lot of testing and is
generally less stable than  the production releases that we will continue to
deliver as tar-balls at www.openvdb.org/download

For documentation of the library and code examples see:
www.openvdb.org/documentation/doxygen
